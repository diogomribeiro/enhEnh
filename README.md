# Single cell enhancer-enhancer co-activity project

This repository contains scripts for data processing, analysis and figure generation data for our preprint:

[Ziyani C, Delaneau O, Ribeiro DM. **Widespread enhancer co-activity identified by multimodal single cell analysis.** bioRxiv (2022).](BIORXIV/2022/511947)

## Analysis scripts
- **calculate_enh_enh_correlation.R** : Script to calculate enhancer-enhancer correlation from single cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq for the same cells
- ** plot_code** R scripts to plot main and supplementary figures of the manuscript
- ** support_code ** : scripts to create intermediate files to make plots

## Data availability
The enhancer-enhancer associations produced are available for download as Supplementary Data. Input data used in this study is available in the public domain. LCL single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq (SHARE-seq) processed data is publicly available through GEO (accession: GSE140203).
